# Experimental Extensions Gallery, Explained
The Experimental Extensions Gallery is something aimed to replace the extra extensions already in the Editor.<br />
It will work by there only being the core scratch 3 extensions in the beginning; pen, video sensing, animated text, and whatever the other hardware stuff is.<br />
You click a button on the tag selector, then it will open https://snail-ide.com/extensions in a new tab.<br />
When you enter the page, there is a lot of extensions for you to choose from. **These extensions are fetched from gallerys outside of Snail IDE.** We've asked for permission this time and we can actually add them.<br />
The reason we're doing this is because in Snail IDE's very early days the developer was taking extensions, adding them to Snail IDE, **without realizing credit is required.**<br />
*and also because the current extension library is bloated*<br />
# When will this be added?
**We don't really know yet.**<br />
I suck at some of the things scratch uses internally which will make development take longer.<br />
But even then, the Experimental Extensions Gallery is low-priority and we're currently working on a ton of things besides the new gallery.<br />
