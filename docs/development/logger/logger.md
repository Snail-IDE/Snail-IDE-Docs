# What is the Snail IDE Logger?
The Snail IDE logger is things being printed into the command line when certain actions happen, they are distinguishable from other warnings and logs because they start with Snail IDE VM Logger:

# What is it Useful For?
It can be used to see if certain events are actually being ran in the vm, so lets say the when flag click script stops working. You can open the console and click the purple flag, if nothing pops up for the purple flag, something is wrong, and you may need to refresh.

# How do I Get to The Logger?
Since it lives in the console, you can usually press F12 to open it, and switch to console. Or you can inspect element and press console. This does depend on your browser however. You should have it since most web browsers have the console. Sometimes, school computers will block the console.
